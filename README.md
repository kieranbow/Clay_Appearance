This is a repository for my Clay Apperance coursework.

## Introduction 
The task was to use a game engine like Unreal or Unity and try to replicate the appearance of clay using shaders.

## Project
- The project explores using Multi-layered BRDF to simulate surfaces that contain multiple layers like clay.
- This project uses Unity 2021.1.21f1 with the Standard Rendering Pipeline (SRP).

## Contents
- Unity project
  - 4 shaders which include:
    - Physically Based Rendering (PBR) shader.
    - Physically Based Rendering (PBR) shader with Disney Clear Coat Gloss.
    - Multi-layered BRDF shader.
    - Clay shader.
  - Scenes with multple meshes and materials showcasing the shaders.
- The report which explains:
  - The research
  - Implimentation of the clay shader
  - An evalution explaining how well the shader does at replicating the appearance of clay
